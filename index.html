  G'day, mate. Jack Mitchell here.
Right then, let's get down to business. You're looking to build a top-tier steakhouse and a powerhouse online retail brand. It's a bold move, but with the right plan, the right product, and a hell of a lot of hard work, it's more than achievable. I've spent two decades in this game, from the paddocks of the Kimberley to the pass of a three-hatted restaurant, and I've seen what works and what sends people packing.
This playbook isn't just a guide; it's a blueprint. It's the sum of my experience, my wins, and my mistakes. We'll cover everything from the philosophy of the beast to the cold, hard numbers on a spreadsheet. We'll talk about the art of the cut, the science of the age, and the logistics of getting a perfectly chilled piece of prime Australian beef from our paddock to a plate in Perth or a penthouse in Dubai.
Forget the fluff. This is the real oil. Read it, learn it, and then get ready to execute. Let's build something that lasts.
1. Executive Snapshot
Our venture is a dual-revenue stream business model, comprising a high-end, "paddock-to-plate" steakhouse and a parallel direct-to-consumer (DTC) e-commerce store. The concept, "Mitchell's Premium Meats," is founded on the principles of transparency, exceptional quality, and whole-animal utilisation. We will exclusively source from a curated network of elite Australian breeders, focusing on superior genetics in Angus, Hereford, and Fullblood Wagyu. Our unique selling proposition is threefold: 1) A "butcher's cellar" dining experience where guests can select their specific cut, graded to AUS-MEAT and MSA standards, from a climate-controlled, dry-aging display. 2) A vertically integrated online store shipping restaurant-grade, cryovaced, and expertly portioned steaks Australia-wide and to key international markets. 3) A radical commitment to sustainability, ensuring every part of the carcass is valorised, from prime cuts to house-made charcuterie and rich bone broths, maximising yield and minimising waste. Our target market is affluent diners, corporate clients, and discerning home cooks who value provenance and are willing to pay a premium for a world-class product and a genuine story.
2. Step-by-Step Launch Roadmap
1. Market Research & Positioning
Competitor Analysis (Restaurant):
Identify the top 5-10 steakhouses in your target city (e.g., Sydney, Melbourne).
Analyse their menus, price points, sourcing claims (e.g., "Grass-fed," "Wagyu"), and online reviews.
Dine at the top 3 to assess atmosphere, service quality, and product execution. Identify their weaknesses – is their "Wagyu" a low-marbling score crossbreed? Is their service knowledgeable or merely functional?
Map out their locations to identify geographic gaps in the premium dining market.
Competitor Analysis (E-commerce):
Identify the top 5 online meat retailers in Australia (e.g., Vic's Meats, Haverick Meats).
Analyse their product range, pricing, packaging, shipping costs/speed, and user experience.
Order from the top 3 to evaluate the entire customer journey, from placing the order to unboxing the product. Assess the cold chain integrity upon arrival.
Target Audience Definition:
Restaurant: High-income professionals (Ages 35-65), corporate entertainment accounts, special occasion diners, international tourists.
E-commerce: Affluent home cooks, BBQ enthusiasts, foodies, gift-givers, and ex-pats seeking a taste of home.
Unique Selling Proposition (USP) Refinement:
Based on competitor gaps, solidify your core message. Examples: "The only steakhouse in Sydney with its own in-house whole-animal butchery and 365-day dry-aging program," or "Australia's first carbon-neutral, nose-to-tail premium meat delivery service."
2. Location Scouting & Lease Negotiation
Criteria for Restaurant Site:
Visibility & Accessibility: High foot traffic, proximity to CBD, corporate offices, luxury hotels, and high-end residential areas. Good public transport links and parking availability.
Size: Minimum 300-500 square meters to accommodate a 100-150 seat dining room, bar, private dining room, kitchen, and the crucial dry-aging display/butchery room.
Infrastructure: Essential services must be robust – high-capacity gas line, 3-phase power, adequate ventilation/exhaust potential, and a loading dock for deliveries.
Zoning: Ensure the location is zoned for restaurant use (Class 6 in many Australian states).
Lease Negotiation:
Engage a commercial real estate agent specialising in hospitality.
Negotiate a long-term lease (e.g., 5 + 5 + 5 years) to secure tenure.
Push for a landlord contribution to the fit-out, especially for major HVAC and structural work.
Clarify all outgoings, rent review mechanisms, and make-good clauses at the end of the lease.
E-commerce Hub Location:
This can be co-located with the restaurant if space permits, or at a more affordable industrial unit with proximity to major freight corridors and the airport. The key is access to logistics networks.
3. Licensing, Food-Safety Compliance (AUS & Export)
Australian Domestic Compliance:
Business Registration: Register your company name and obtain an Australian Business Number (ABN).
Local Council: Apply for a Food Business License. This will trigger inspections of your plans and final fit-out.
Liquor License: This is a critical, often lengthy, process. Engage a specialist consultant. You'll need a comprehensive plan covering Responsible Service of Alcohol (RSA) for all staff.
HACCP Plan: Develop and implement a Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP) plan. This is mandatory. It identifies and controls food safety risks at every stage, from receiving to serving.
PrimeSafe/State Authority: Your butchery and processing operations will be licensed and audited by the relevant state food authority (e.g., PrimeSafe in Victoria, NSW Food Authority).
Export Compliance:
Export Registration: Register with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (DAFF) as a registered meat establishment. This involves a rigorous audit process.
Approved Arrangement (AA): You must have a DAFF-approved AA, which details how you will meet all export requirements, including traceability, hygiene, and labelling.
Market-Specific Requirements: Each target market (USA, Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE) has unique requirements.
USA: Requires compliance with USDA Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) regulations. Your facility will need to be listed as eligible to export to the US.
Singapore/Hong Kong: Have specific labelling and documentation requirements.
UAE: Requires Halal certification from a DAFF-recognised Islamic body for any products to be marketed as such.
Export Documentation: You will need to master the preparation of Health Certificates, Certificates of Origin, and commercial invoices for every shipment.
4. Supply-Chain & Breeder Partnerships
Philosophy: Go beyond a simple transactional relationship. These are partnerships. You are the final custodian of their life's work.
Breeder Selection:
Identify breeders renowned for specific traits: e.g., David Blackmore for Fullblood Wagyu, select King Island farms for premium grass-fed Angus.
Visit the farms. Understand their husbandry practices, feeding regimes, and commitment to animal welfare and sustainability. This is your brand story.
Focus on genetics, not just brand names. Look for proven sires and dams.
Sourcing Model:
Whole Carcass Program: For maximum margin and to fulfil your nose-to-tail ethos, purchase whole or half carcasses. This gives you control over every cut but requires significant butchery skill and space.
Primal Program: Supplement with specific primals (e.g., an extra box of cube rolls if rib-eyes are selling fast) from trusted processors who share your quality standards.
Grading & Specifications:
All carcasses must be graded by an accredited AUS-MEAT grader.
Specify your requirements:
AUS-MEAT Marbling Score: e.g., minimum MB 3 for Angus, MB 7+ for Wagyu.
MSA Score: Target a minimum MSA score of 62+ for superior eating quality.
Other Specs: Specify meat colour (1B-3), fat colour (0-3), fat depth, and animal age (no older than 30 months).
Contracts:
Establish formal supply agreements that outline quality specs, pricing mechanisms (e.g., based on $/kg hot standard carcass weight), delivery schedules, and payment terms. See Appendix for a sample contract outline.
5. Kitchen Layout & Front-of-House Design
Kitchen (The Engine Room):
Flow: Design for a logical flow: Receiving → Cold Storage/Butchery → Prep → Grill Station → Plating → Service. Minimise staff movement and cross-contamination risks.
Butchery & Aging: A dedicated, temperature-controlled glass-fronted room is a key design feature. It requires its own refrigeration unit (1-3°C), humidity control (75-85%), and UV lighting.
Grill Station: This is the heart of the kitchen. A wood-fired or charcoal grill (e.g., Josper, Mibrasa) is non-negotiable for flavour. Supplement with high-speed overhead salamanders for finishing.
Other Stations: Dedicated stations for pastry, hot sides, cold sides/salads, and a well-organised pass.
Front-of-House (The Theatre):
Atmosphere: Aim for "sophisticated comfort." Use natural materials like wood, leather, and stone. Lighting is critical – create intimacy at tables but showcase the bar and dry-aging room.
Seating Mix: Offer a mix of standard tables, booths for larger groups, bar seating, and a private dining room (PDR). The PDR is a key revenue driver for corporate events.
The "Cellar" Experience: Design the guest journey to pass the dry-aging room. A "meat sommelier" or the head butcher can present cuts to guests tableside on a trolley.
Acoustics: Invest in acoustic panelling or soft furnishings to manage noise levels. Guests should be able to converse comfortably.
6. Staffing & Training Plan
Key Hires (Pre-Opening):
General Manager: Experienced in high-end restaurant operations, P&L management, and team leadership.
Head Chef: A true steak expert who understands meat science, whole-animal butchery, and open-flame cooking.
Head Butcher: A master craftsman responsible for receiving, breaking down carcasses, portioning, and managing the dry-aging program. This role is as important as the Head Chef.
E-commerce Manager: Experience in Shopify/Magento, digital marketing, and cold-chain logistics.
Staffing Structure:
Kitchen Brigade: Sous Chefs, Grill Chefs, Pastry Chef, Apprentices.
FOH Team: Restaurant Manager, Sommelier, Bartenders, Waitstaff (Meat Sommeliers), Hosts, Runners.
E-commerce/Butchery Team: Online order fulfilment staff, packers.
Training (The "Mitchell Method"):
Develop a comprehensive 4-week onboarding syllabus (see Appendix).
Week 1: The Product. Deep dive into Australian beef breeds, grading (AUS-MEAT vs. MSA), and our partner farms.
Week 2: The Process. Kitchen and butchery immersion. Staff learn every cut, witness the dry-aging process, and understand whole-animal utilisation.
Week 3: The Service. FOH staff undergo intensive role-playing on table service, menu explanation, wine pairing, and upselling. They must be able to confidently explain the difference between a Hanger and a Skirt steak.
Week 4: The Systems. Training on POS, reservation systems, and e-commerce order management. Full dress rehearsals and mock services.
7. Branding, Menu Engineering, and Pricing Strategy
Branding:
Name: "Mitchell's Premium Meats" or similar, conveying authority and quality.
Logo & Visual Identity: Classic, strong typography. Colours inspired by nature: dark greens, charcoal, rich browns. High-quality photography of the cattle, the farms, and the finished product is essential.
Menu Engineering:
Structure:
Appetisers: Include items from the whole-animal program (e.g., beef tartare, bone marrow, house-cured bresaola).
The Grill: The star of the show. List cuts by category (e.g., "Grass-Fed," "Grain-Fed Angus," "Fullblood Wagyu"). Offer a range of sizes.
Large Format: Offer "Feasts" like a whole slow-roasted short rib or a 1.5kg Tomahawk for sharing.
Sides & Sauces: Classic steakhouse sides (creamed spinach, fries) but executed perfectly. Offer house-made sauces (béarnaise, peppercorn, red wine jus).
Desserts: Classic, comforting options.
Pricing Strategy:
Costing: Use a spreadsheet to calculate the plate cost for every single menu item. Factor in the raw ingredient cost, a percentage for waste/trim (even if reused), and a small allocation for kitchen consumables.
Target Food Cost %: Aim for a blended food cost of 28-32%. Prime cuts like Wagyu will have a higher cost % (closer to 40%), which must be balanced by lower-cost items like sides, burgers, and appetisers.
Retail Pricing (Online): Price per kg. Benchmark against competitors but justify your premium with superior grading, provenance, and packaging. Offer bundles and subscription boxes for better value and recurring revenue.
8. E-commerce Tech Stack, Cold-Chain Logistics, Packaging
Tech Stack:
Platform: Shopify Advanced or Magento. They are robust, scalable, and have strong ecosystems of apps for subscriptions, logistics, and marketing.
Key Apps/Integrations:
Subscription Management: Recharge or Bold Subscriptions.
Shipping Calculator: Shippit or Starshipit to integrate with multiple couriers and provide real-time rates.
Inventory Management: Link your e-commerce inventory directly with your butchery's production plan. Cin7 or DEAR Systems can handle this complexity.
Email Marketing: Klaviyo for powerful segmentation and automated customer journeys.
Cold-Chain Logistics (Domestic):
See Section 7 for a deep dive.
Packaging:
Primary: All steaks must be cryovaced in high-barrier vacuum bags (minimum 80 microns) to prevent moisture loss and freezer burn.
Secondary (Insulation):
Standard: Expanded Polystyrene (EPS) boxes offer the best thermal performance but are environmentally poor.
Premium/Eco: Use insulated liners made from recycled fibres or wool (e.g., Woolcool). These are curbside recyclable and align with a premium, sustainable brand image.
Tertiary (Coolant): Gel ice packs or dry ice. Calculate needs based on transit time and external temperature forecasts.
Branding: The unboxing experience is a key marketing touchpoint. Custom printed boxes, branded tape, and a personalised note or cooking guide inside.
9. Marketing Calendar (Launch + First 12 Months)
Pre-Launch (Months -3 to -1):
PR: Engage a food/hospitality PR agency. Announce the project, key hires, and unique concept.
Social Media: Start building a following on Instagram/Facebook with high-quality "behind-the-scenes" content: farm visits, fit-out progress, chef profiles.
Email List: Create a landing page to capture email addresses, offering early access or a launch promotion.
Launch (Month 0):
VIP Opening Night: Invite media, influencers, and local concierges. Create a buzz.
Launch PR Campaign: Push for reviews in major publications (Good Food, Gourmet Traveller).
Digital Ad Campaign: Targeted ads on social media and Google for users searching "best steakhouse," "Wagyu," etc.
E-commerce Launch: A coordinated email blast to your list with a special launch offer (e.g., free shipping or a complimentary steak knife).
First 12 Months (Ongoing):
Monthly Content: A blog/newsletter with "Butcher's Notes," recipes, and farm stories.
Seasonal Promotions: Create special menus or online bundles for events like Father's Day, Christmas, and BBQ season.
Collaborations: Partner with wineries for degustation dinners. Collaborate with food influencers for online content.
Corporate Program: Actively market the PDR and restaurant to local businesses for corporate dining.
Loyalty Program: Implement a points-based system for both restaurant and online customers.
10. KPI Dashboard & Break-Even Analysis
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): Track these weekly.

4. Whole-Animal Utilisation Plan
This is the cornerstone of our profitability and sustainability claim. Buying a whole carcass means we pay a lower average price per kilo, but we acquire everything. The mission is to monetise every gram.
Prime Cuts (Rib-eyes, Striploins, Tenderloins): These are the hero products for the restaurant grill and premium online packs. They carry the highest margin and drive the brand's reputation.
Secondary Cuts (Rump, Topside, Knuckle, Silverside):
Restaurant: Rump caps (Picanha) on the grill. Silverside for house-cured corned beef for sandwiches or a special. Topside for minute steaks or schnitzels on the bar menu.
Retail/Butchery: Sold as affordable roasts, steaks, or diced for stir-fry/casserole packs.
Tertiary Cuts & "Butcher's Cuts" (Hanger, Skirt, Flank, Tri-Tip, Chuck):
Restaurant: These are your "steak frites" cuts. They offer incredible flavour at a lower price point, making the menu more accessible. Feature them as a "Butcher's Cut of the Day."
Retail/Butchery: Market these to foodies and BBQ enthusiasts who know how to handle them. They are high-margin online items.
Trim & Fat:
High-Quality Trim (from prime cuts): This is ground for your signature Steakhouse Burger. Never use scraps; use high-quality, well-marbled trim. This burger should be a profit centre.
Aged Fat & Trim: The pellicle from dry-aged primals has intense flavour. Render this fat down to make beef tallow for frying your chips/fries. A small amount can be minced into the burger blend for extra funk and flavour.
Wagyu Fat: This is liquid gold. Render it and sell it in jars online. Use it for confit preparations in the kitchen.
Bones & Connective Tissue:
Bones: Roast them slowly, then simmer for 24-48 hours to create a rich, collagen-heavy Beef Stock. This is the base for all your pan sauces (jus) and soups. Offer it for sale online as a "Bone Broth" health product.
Sinew & Tendon: After slow-braising, these become gelatinous and delicious. Use them in pies, terrines, or a staff meal.
Offal & Other Parts:
Liver: Use for a classic liver pâté or parfait to serve with bread as an appetiser.
Heart/Tongue/Cheeks: These are culinary delicacies. Braise the cheeks and tongue until tender. They can be high-margin specials for adventurous diners.
Hides: Connect with a local leather artisan to create branded items like coasters, menu covers, or aprons, completing the cycle.
5. Cooking Technique Cheat-Sheets
For the Pro Chef (Laminated for the Grill Station)
SUBJECT: 350g Dry-Aged Angus Scotch Fillet (MB4+)
TARGET: Medium-Rare (54°C / 129°F)
PREP (15 mins prior): Remove from fridge. Allow to temper on a wire rack.
SEASON: Pat dry. Season aggressively with coarse sea salt (e.g., Murray River Pink Salt) and coarse black pepper. Do not oil the steak; oil the grill.
SEAR (The 'Sizzle'):
Grill temp: 300°C / 570°F.
Place steak on hottest part of the grill at a 45° angle. Press firmly for 5 seconds.
Sear for 90 seconds. Do not move it.
Rotate steak 90 degrees to create diamond grill marks. Sear for another 90 seconds.
COOK (The 'Finish'):
Flip steak. Place on a cooler part of the grill (~180°C / 355°F).
Cook for 3-4 minutes, monitoring internal temperature with a digital probe.
Optional: Add a knob of compound butter (e.g., garlic & thyme) in the final minute.
REST (Critical):
Remove from grill at 51°C / 124°F (will carry over ~3°C).
Place on a warm plate or wire rack, tented loosely with foil.
Rest for 8-10 minutes (Minimum 50% of cook time).
SERVE: Slice against the grain if requested. Garnish with flaky sea salt.
COMMON MISTAKES: Not patting steak dry (prevents crust). Fiddling with the steak during searing. Not resting long enough (juices will bleed out). Using a fork to turn (pierces meat).
For the Home Customer (A6 Card included in every online order)
SUBJECT: Your Perfect Steak Experience
CUT: 250g Grass-Fed Striploin
Thank you for choosing Mitchell's. Here's how to cook this steak to perfection.
PREPARE (The Foundation):
Take the steak out of the fridge 30-45 minutes before cooking. Let it come towards room temperature for an even cook.
Pat it completely dry with a paper towel. This is the secret to a great crust!
Season generously on all sides with salt and pepper.
COOK (The Action):
Use a heavy-based pan (cast iron is best). Add a teaspoon of neutral oil (like grapeseed) and heat until it shimmers (just before it smokes).
Carefully lay the steak in the pan, away from you.
For Medium-Rare: Cook for about 3 minutes per side. For the final minute, add a knob of butter, a crushed garlic clove, and a sprig of thyme to the pan and spoon it over the steak.
Internal Temperature Guide (use a meat thermometer for accuracy):
Rare: 52°C / 125°F
Medium-Rare: 55°C / 131°F
Medium: 60°C / 140°F
REST (The Magic):
This is the most important step! Place your cooked steak on a plate and let it rest for 5-7 minutes. This allows the juices to redistribute, making the steak tender and flavourful.
CARVE & ENJOY:
Slice the steak against the grain (the lines of the muscle). This makes it easier to chew. Enjoy the best steak you've ever cooked!
COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID: Cooking a cold steak. A crowded or not-hot-enough pan. Skipping the rest.

7. Cold-Chain & Export Logistics
This is a zero-failure-tolerance zone. A breach in the cold chain ruins the product and your reputation.
Packaging Specifications:
Product: Cryovaced in 80-100 micron, food-safe, high-barrier plastic.
Insulated Box:
Domestic (Standard): Moulded EPS Foam Box with a tight-fitting lid.
Domestic/International (Premium Eco): Curbside-recyclable cardboard box lined with >25mm thick natural fibre insulation (e.g., Woolcool, recycled cotton). This is a strong branding element.
Refrigerant:
Calculation: The amount of dry ice or gel packs needed depends on:
Payload weight (kg of meat).
Box volume and thermal efficiency (k-value).
Transit time in hours.
Maximum forecast ambient temperature. Use a supplier's calculator initially, then perform your own real-world tests.
Dry Ice (CO₂): Provides the most cooling power per kg. Sublimes, leaving no residue. Requires careful handling (gloves) and vented boxes. Essential for international air freight.
Gel Packs: Best for standard domestic overnight shipping. Must be frozen to at least -18°C for 24 hours prior.
Courier Service Level Agreements (SLAs):
Domestic: Use a premium courier service like StarTrack Premium or specialised cold-chain couriers. The SLA must guarantee next-day delivery for 98%+ of postcodes. Do not use standard parcel post.
International: Partner with a major freight forwarder (e.g., DHL, FedEx) with a dedicated cold-chain service. They will handle the air freight and customs brokerage.
Customs & Documentation (The Paper Trail):
Work with your freight forwarder/customs broker. Each shipment requires:
Commercial Invoice: Detailed list of contents, value, and Harmonized System (HS) codes for meat products.

10. Customer FAQ (Top 25)
Sourcing & Quality
Where does your beef come from? We partner directly with a select group of Australia's finest cattle farmers, focusing on specific regions like King Island, the New England Tablelands, and the Darling Downs. Each farm is chosen for its commitment to ethical animal husbandry and superior genetics.
What does "grass-fed" vs "grain-fed" mean? Grass-fed cattle graze on pasture their entire lives, resulting in a leaner meat with a classic, mineral-rich beef flavour. Grain-fed cattle are finished on a carefully managed diet of grains for the final 100-400 days, which increases the marbling (intramuscular fat), resulting in a richer, more buttery flavour.
What is Wagyu? Wagyu is a breed of Japanese cattle genetically predisposed to intense marbling. Fullblood Wagyu is 100% pure, while crossbred Wagyu (often with Angus) offers a balance of Wagyu's richness and the robust flavour of traditional breeds.
What do the marble scores (MB) mean? The AUS-MEAT marbling score is a visual assessment of the amount of intramuscular fat, from 1 (lean) to 9+ (intensely marbled). A higher score means a richer, more tender steak.
What is MSA Grading? Meat Standards Australia (MSA) is a comprehensive eating quality grading system. It predicts tenderness, juiciness, and flavour based on a range of factors beyond just marbling, including animal age, pH, and hanging method. It's a guarantee of quality.
Is your meat Halal? We can source Halal-certified beef and process it accordingly for our export markets and upon request for restaurant functions. Please inquire with our team.
What is dry-aging? Dry-aging is a process where whole primals of beef are aged in a special climate-controlled room. For 28-100+ days, moisture evaporates, concentrating the flavour, while natural enzymes break down connective tissues, making the meat incredibly tender and adding complex, nutty notes.
Ordering & Shipping (Online)
8. How is my order shipped? We ship your cryovaced steaks in an insulated box with frozen gel packs or dry ice to maintain a temperature below 5°C during transit.
9. How long does shipping take? We use a premium overnight courier service. Most metro areas will receive their order the day after it is dispatched.
10. What if I'm not home? The insulated box will keep the meat safely chilled for several hours. Our couriers are instructed to leave it in a safe, shaded spot.
11. What is the shipping cost? Shipping is calculated at checkout based on your location and order size. We offer free shipping on orders over a certain value (e.g., $250).
12. Do you ship internationally? Yes, we ship to Singapore, Hong Kong, the USA, and the UAE. This involves special packaging and documentation, and shipping costs are calculated at checkout.
13. What is the shelf life of the meat? In its cryovac bag, the meat will last for up to 4 weeks in the coldest part of your fridge (check the use-by date on the pack). Once opened, consume within 2-3 days.
14. Can I freeze the steaks? Yes. The meat can be frozen in its original cryovac packaging for up to 6 months.
15. How do I thaw a frozen steak? The best way is to place it in the refrigerator for 24-48 hours. Never use a microwave or hot water.
16. What is your refund policy? If your order does not arrive in a satisfactory condition, please contact us within 24 hours with photos, and we will arrange a replacement or refund.
Restaurant & General
17. Do I need a reservation? Yes, reservations are highly recommended, especially on weekends.
18. Do you have a dress code? We suggest smart casual.
19. Do you cater for dietary requirements? Absolutely. Please inform us of any allergies or dietary needs when you book, and our chefs will be happy to accommodate you.
20. Can I choose my own steak? Yes! This is a core part of our experience. Our "Meat Sommelier" can guide you through the cuts available in our dry-ager.
21. Do you have vegetarian options? Yes, we offer a small selection of thoughtfully created vegetarian and seafood dishes.
22. Do you have a loyalty program? Yes, the "Mitchell's Meat Club" offers points on every dollar spent in the restaurant and online, redeemable for discounts, special cuts, and exclusive event invitations.
23. Do you sell gift cards? Yes, both physical and e-gift cards are available for purchase online and at the restaurant.
24. Can I book a private function? Yes, our Private Dining Room can be booked for corporate events and special occasions. Please contact our events manager.
25. Why are your steaks more expensive than at the supermarket? We source directly from elite, low-volume producers who focus on ethical and sustainable practices. Our meat is graded to a much higher standard, expertly aged, and butchered in-house. You are paying for a demonstrably superior product in terms of flavour, tenderness, and provenance.
